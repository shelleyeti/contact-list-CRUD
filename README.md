# Practice: Contact List

## Build four components:

1. A **ContactCollection** component that loads existing contacts from a json-server API, and saves new ones.
1. A **Contact** component that displays a person's name, phone number, and address.
1. A **ContactLis**t component that displays all contacts. It should import the Contact component and the **ContactCollection** component.
1. A **ContactForm** component that listens for when the submit button is pressed. When it is triggered, a new contact should be POSTed to the API. It should import the **ContactCollection** component.
